## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving

This project is an investment calculator that helps users calculate the year-end balances of their investments based on initial investment, monthly deposits, annual interest rate, and the number of years. It provides a summary of the investment details entered by the user and then calculates and displays the year-end balances with and without monthly deposits. The project solves the problem of manual calculation and tracking of investment growth over time, providing users with a convenient tool to understand the potential outcomes of their investments.

## What did you do particularly well?

One area that I did particularly well in was following industry standards by making code that adhered to object-oriented programming principles as well as including comments so the program is easily maintainable, readable, and adaptable.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

The code could be enhanced by adding input validation to handle invalid user inputs. For example, it could check if the input values for initial investment, monthly deposit, annual interest, and number of years are within reasonable ranges and are of the expected data types. This would make the code more robust and prevent unexpected errors or incorrect calculations due to invalid inputs. Additionally, the code could handle potential division by zero errors if the user enters zero for the annual interest rate.

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging pieces of code to write in this project were the calculations for the year-end balances and interest earned. These calculations involved compound interest and iterative calculations over multiple years. To overcome this challenge, the calculations are broken into smaller steps. Additionally, utilizing mathematical formulas and concepts related to compound interest can help ensure accurate calculations. Online resources, textbooks, and/or financial calculators were useful tools for understanding and verifying the calculations.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The skills from this project that can be transferred to other projects or coursework include:

- Object-oriented programming principles: The project demonstrates the use of classes, encapsulation, and separation of concerns to organize code and provide a modular structure.
- Input/output handling: The code showcases how to handle user input, display informative messages, and format output for better readability.
- Mathematical calculations: The project involves calculations related to compound interest and year-end balances, which can be applicable in various financial and mathematical contexts.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable due to the following factors:

- The use of a class and encapsulation allows for easy maintenance and extension of the code. If additional functionality is required, it can be added within the class without affecting the rest of the code.
- The code uses clear and descriptive variable and function names, making it readable and understandable.
- The program is adaptable as it separates the input/output handling from the core logic, making it flexible to integrate with different user interfaces or platforms.
- The code includes comments that provide additional explanations and improve code comprehension, aiding in maintenance and future development.
